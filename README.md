Repo to hold my solutions to the levels in the game [Exapunks by Zachtronics](https://www.zachtronics.com/exapunks/).  I also have a section of notes that I've written down in hopes that I won't forget them or they will help others. They were hard learned lessons, only look if you don't mind spoilers.  

The files created for individual levels are in the appropriate Level folders. When possible I try to include the level name and a file for my first working attempt, lowest cycles, smallest size, and lowest actions. (when needed, sometimes either cycles or size also covers actions)  Often times I will spend hours on a single level and end up with tons of solutions, so I will only try to include the ones I think worthy of mention.
